need to remove the white line between items
change color programatically
add action listener




might use ColorStateList to change focus
	for android:textColor we can use colors under /color
	for android:backGround we need to use drawable under /drawable, need the definition is differernt from regular color, need a <shape> inside

use a homemade base adaptor instead of arrayadaptor, looks like we can change the background color in getView() method
	-but that would make the logic no generic - do we need to do the overriding in both Menulist adaptor which it only gets stuff from array, and from a cursor adaptor?
		ideally we should be able to get the style from xml layout without any java code. but if dynamically generating random color is not doable from xml, we should use a composition to isolate the getView() logic in an item
		or we should change the color programmatically in BaseList level
		ListView.getChildAt() returns null for non visiable childs
		will first just use a customized adaptor -done

add a menu icon float on list
	-done by hacking a framelayout to menulist  




transition animation between views Ôºç use fragmentation animations - done
